Hi, I’m @Dr-schobi.

I’m an electrical engineer, interested in making stufff, in electronic imaging, embedded software and electronics.

Over the years, I've built many different tools for myself. But after a few years, it became increasingly hard to continue using, reparing and working with the old projects.
This page tries to collect information and documentation for those one-off projects.
